# YouTube Downloader for Telegram

A Telegram bot powered by AWS Lambda that allows users to download YouTube videos in different qualities, download audio from YouTube videos in MP3 format, and send them directly via Telegram or through a presigned S3 download link for larger files.

## üåü Features

- Download YouTube videos in 4 different resolutions (240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p)
- Download audio from YouTube videos in MP3 format
- Direct sending of videos/audio under 50 MB via Telegram
- Automatic storage on AWS S3 and generation of presigned links for files over 50 MB
- YouTube cookies management to access age-restricted content
- Commands to list and delete stored videos/audios

## üìã Available Commands

- `/start` - Start the bot
- `/list` - List all the videos/audios stored in the S3 bucket
- `/delete filename.zip` - Delete a specific video/audio from the S3 bucket
- `/help` - Display help with all available commands

To download a video/audio, simply send:
```
[YouTube URL] [resolution]
```

## üé• Available resolutions and formats:

- `low` (240p)
- `medium` (480p)
- `high` (720p)
- `veryhigh` (1080p)
- `mp3` (audio only)

## üìù Examples:

For video:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example medium
```

For audio only:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example mp3
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The bot is built with:
- AWS Lambda for code execution
- AWS Lambda layers for yt-dlp and FFmpeg
- AWS S3 for vides and cookies storage
- AWS Secrets Manager for securely managing the Telegram bot token
- AWS API Gateway for the Telegram webhook
- AWS IAM for managing permissions

## üîß Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- A Telegram bot (created via @BotFather)

## üöÄ Deployment

### üë∑ Lambda function

Create an AWS Lambda function and upload the code from `lambda_function.py` (Adapt the GLOBAL VARIABLES in the beginning of the file)

### üõ†Ô∏è Add layers containing yt-dlp and FFmpeg

To create a Lambda layer for yt-dlp, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for the layer:
   ```bash
   mkdir yt-dlp-layer && cd yt-dlp-layer
   ```

2. Create a `bin` directory inside it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p bin
   ```

3. Download `yt-dlp`:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o bin/yt-dlp
   ```

4. Make the downloaded file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bin/yt-dlp
   ```

5. Zip the layer:
   ```bash
   zip -r yt-dlp-layer.zip bin
   ```

6. Upload the zip file to Lambda as a new layer and assign it to your Lambda function.

For the FFmpeg layer, follow the steps of this tutorial [here](https://virkud-sarvesh.medium.com/building-ffmpeg-layer-for-a-lambda-function-a206f36d3edc) but instead of storing in S3, upload the final zip file to Lambda as a new layer and assign it to your Lambda function.

Note that when creating a layer, you need to select "Compatible runtimes" as your python version you are using across your AWS services for this project.

### üåê API Gateway

1. Create a new HTTP API
2. Add a new integration with your Lambda function
3. Choose "Method" as ANY for simplicity, the "Resource path" like "/my_api", and "Integration target" as your Lambda function name
4. Keep Stage name as "$default" and "Auto-deployed" selected
5. Get webhook info by using this url https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo
6. Add webhook by using this url https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<API_GATEWAY_URL>
7. (Optional) Delete webhook by using this url https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/deleteWebhook

### ü™£ S3 bucket for Cookies and stored youtube videos

Yt-dlp sometimes needs cookies to work

1. Export your youtube cookies with a Chrome extention like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"
2. Create a new S3 bucket to store the cookies file
3. Upload the youtube cookies .txt file to the bucket
4. Adapt the `lambda_function.py` file to use the bucket name and file key (i.e. the path in the bucket)

Create an S3 bucket to store downloaded videos that are larger than 50MB.

### üõ°Ô∏è IAM Permissions

Configure IAM permissions to access S3 ("s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:DeleteObject") and Secrets Manager ("secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"). You can do it in the Lambda function Configuration > Permissions > Click on the Role name > Add permissions > Create inline policy > Add the required permissions.

The S3 policy looks like this:
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "S3Access",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yt-downloaded-videos"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "S3ObjectAccessDlVideos",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:PutObject",
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:DeleteObject"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::yt-downloaded-videos/*"
			]
		},
		{
			"Sid": "S3ObjectAccessCookies",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::yt-cookies/youtube_cookies.txt"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

The Secrets Manager policy looks like this:
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "SecretManagerAccess",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:Telegram-bot-token-*"
		}
	]
}
```

The Lambda policy (for the Lambda function to be able to invoke itself) looks like this:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:{aws_region}:{aws_account_id}:function:yt_dl_bot_lambda_function"
        }
    ]
}
```

## üìù Notes

- Files larger than 50MB are automatically stored on S3 and shared via a presigned link (valid for 1 hour), because Telegram API has a file size limit of 50MB
- Debug using CloudWatch Log groups and Lambda function logs located in the Monitoring tab
